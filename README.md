# Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

User github pages are deployed from master, so the code is in the `code` branch. Changes are made there and then deployed via `yarn deploy`.

## Getting Started

Go to `code` branch, and run:

```bash
# possible pre-start step
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider

# just for initial setup, install packages
yarn install

# start the web app
yarn start
```
